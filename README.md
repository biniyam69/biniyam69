# 🤖 Biniyam | AI & Backend Engineer

[cite_start]I build production-grade AI systems that move past the "wrapper" stage[cite: 5, 6]. [cite_start]I’m a Software Engineer and Machine Learning specialist focused on the intersection of LLMs, high-performance backends, and MLOps[cite: 2, 5]. [cite_start]If it involves shipping RAG pipelines, autonomous agents, or scalable FastAPI infrastructure, I’m probably into it[cite: 5, 13, 44].

### 🛠️ What I’m good at

* [cite_start]**LLMs & RAG:** Architecting retrieval pipelines with LangChain and LlamaIndex, optimizing vector search (Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant), and fine-tuning open-source models like Mistral and Llama 3 on high-compute clusters[cite: 20, 21, 26, 32, 44].
* [cite_start]**Backend & Infra:** Designing concurrent backends with Python (FastAPI/asyncio), managing state with Redis, and deploying via Docker/Kubernetes on AWS or GCP[cite: 13, 32, 44].
* [cite_start]**Voice, Agents & Automation:** Building autonomous agents (LangGraph/Autogen) and AI voice systems that handle multi-step workflows and telephony integration[cite: 41, 44].

### 🏗️ Stuff I like to build

[cite_start]I prefer shipping real systems over writing research papers[cite: 7]. Some recent things I’ve built:

* [cite_start]**RAG over specialized domains:** A medical quiz generator that transforms complex textbooks into interactive learning tools[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Intent-driven RecSys:** Recommendation engines for media that use user intent and emotion signals rather than just simple metadata[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Production AI Pipelines:** Automated story and image generation pipelines for education platforms, focusing on character consistency and multi-lingual validation[cite: 16, 17, 18].
* [cite_start]**Conversational Voice Agents:** AI telephony agents for sales and hospitality that handle FAQs and bookings naturally[cite: 34, 37, 41].
* [cite_start]**Localized LLM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning models for specific languages (like Amharic) to handle localized ad generation and sentiment analysis[cite: 46, 55].

### 🤝 If you want to work with me

* [cite_start]You need a FastAPI service that wraps your model and actually scales[cite: 32, 44].
* [cite_start]You want to move your RAG or agent prototype into a production-ready pipeline[cite: 6, 20].
* [cite_start]You need to optimize vector search speed or implement complex knowledge graphs (Neo4j)[cite: 26, 27, 30].
* [cite_start]You want to automate a messy, multi-tool workflow using LLM agents[cite: 44].
