# 🤖 Biniyam |  AI & Backend Engineer 

I build production-grade AI systems that move past the "wrapper" stage. I’m a Software Engineer and Machine Learning specialist focused on the intersection of LLMs, high-performance backends, and MLOps. If it involves shipping RAG pipelines, autonomous agents, or scalable FastAPI infrastructure, I’m probably into it.

### 🛠️ What I’m good at

* 
**LLMs & RAG**: Architecting retrieval pipelines with LangChain and LlamaIndex, optimizing vector search (Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant), and fine-tuning open-source models like Mistral and Llama 3 on high-compute clusters.


* 
**Backend & Infra**: Designing concurrent backends with Python (FastAPI/asyncio), managing state with Redis, and deploying via Docker/Kubernetes on AWS or GCP.


* 
**Voice, Agents & Automation**: Building autonomous agents (LangGraph/Autogen) and AI voice systems that handle multi-step workflows and telephony integration.



### 🏗️ Stuff I like to build

I prefer shipping real systems over writing research papers. Some recent things I’ve built:

* 
**RAG over specialized domains**: Like a medical quiz generator that transforms complex textbooks into interactive learning tools.


* 
**Intent-driven RecSys**: Recommendation engines for media that use user intent and emotion signals rather than just simple metadata.


* 
**Production AI Pipelines**: Automated story and image generation pipelines for education platforms, focusing on character consistency and multi-lingual validation.


* 
**Conversational Voice Agents**: AI telephony agents for sales and hospitality that handle FAQs and bookings naturally.


* 
**Localized LLM Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning models for specific languages (like Amharic) to handle localized ad generation and sentiment analysis.



### 🤝 If you want to work with me

* You need a FastAPI service that wraps your model and actually scales.


* You want to move your RAG or agent prototype into a production-ready pipeline.


* You need to optimize vector search speed or implement complex knowledge graphs (Neo4j).


* You want to automate a messy, multi-tool workflow using LLM agents.
