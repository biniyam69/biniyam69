# 🤖 Biniyam | AI & Backend Engineer

I build production-grade AI systems that move past the "wrapper" stage. I'm an AI and Software Engineer focused on the intersection of LLMs, high-performance backends, and MLOps. If it involves shipping RAG pipelines, autonomous agents, or scalable FastAPI infrastructure, I'm probably into it.

### 🛠️ What I'm Good At

* **LLMs & RAG:** Architecting retrieval pipelines with LangChain and LlamaIndex, optimizing vector search (Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant), and fine-tuning open-source models like Mistral and Llama 3 on high-compute clusters.
* **Backend & Infra:** Designing concurrent backends with Python (FastAPI/asyncio), managing state with Redis, and deploying via Docker/Kubernetes on AWS or GCP.
* **Voice, Agents & Automation:** Building autonomous agents (LangGraph/Autogen) and AI voice systems that handle multi-step workflows and telephony integration.

### 🏗️ Stuff I Like to Build

I prefer shipping real systems over writing research papers. Some recent things I've built:

* **RAG over Specialized Domains:** A medical quiz generator that transforms complex textbooks into interactive learning tools.
* **Intent-driven RecSys:** Recommendation engines for media that use user intent and emotion signals rather than just simple metadata.
* **Production AI Pipelines:** Automated story and image generation pipelines for education platforms, focusing on character consistency and multi-lingual validation.
* **Conversational Voice Agents:** AI telephony agents for sales and hospitality that handle FAQs and bookings naturally.
* **Localized LLM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning models for specific languages (like Amharic) to handle localized ad generation and sentiment analysis.

### 🤝 Let's Work Together

* You need a FastAPI service that wraps your model and actually scales.
* You want to move your RAG or agent prototype into a production-ready pipeline.
* You need to optimize vector search speed or implement complex knowledge graphs (Neo4j).
* You want to automate a messy, multi-tool workflow using LLM agents.
