# 🤖 Biniyam | AI & Backend Engineer

[cite_start]I am a Machine Learning Engineer and a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in MLOps, CI/CD practices, and backend web development using Python and JavaScript/TypeScript[cite: 5]. [cite_start]My expertise ranges from designing and implementing machine learning models to ensuring seamless integration and deployment through CI/CD pipelines[cite: 6]. [cite_start]I focus on driving efficiency and innovation at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering[cite: 7].

### 🛠️ What I’m good at

* [cite_start]**LLMs & RAG:** Architecting retrieval pipelines with LangChain and LlamaIndex, optimizing vector search with Pinecone and Chroma, and fine-tuning open-source models like Mistral, LLAMA, and DeepSeek[cite: 20, 21, 22, 26, 32, 38, 44].
* [cite_start]**Backend & Infra:** Designing concurrent backends with Python and FastAPI, managing state with Redis, and deploying via Docker and Kubernetes (EKS) on AWS or GCP[cite: 5, 13, 32, 38, 44, 49].
* [cite_start]**Voice, Agents & Automation:** Building autonomous agents using Langgraph and Autogen, and shipping AI voice calling sales agents[cite: 41, 44].

### 🏗️ Stuff I like to build

[cite_start]I prefer shipping real systems over writing research papers[cite: 7]. Some recent things I’ve built:

* [cite_start]**RAG over specialized domains:** Developed a medical quiz generator for students using RAG optimization techniques like hybrid search and reranking[cite: 24, 26].
* [cite_start]**Intent-driven RecSys:** Built a sophisticated movie and music recommendation engine based on user intent and emotion signals[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Production AI Pipelines:** Created image generation pipelines for stories using Stable Diffusion and ControlNets, and built AI pipelines for assignment generation[cite: 16, 18].
* [cite_start]**Conversational Voice Agents:** Coded chatbots for hotels and deployed them to WhatsApp and Messenger, alongside shipping an AI voice calling sales agent[cite: 34, 37, 41].
* [cite_start]**Localized LLM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuned Mistral and Llama 2 on Amharic datasets for ad generation and sentiment analysis[cite: 46, 55].

### 🤝 If you want to work with me

* [cite_start]You need a FastAPI service that wraps your model and actually scales[cite: 32, 44].
* [cite_start]You want to move your RAG or agent prototype into a production-ready pipeline[cite: 6, 20].
* [cite_start]You need to optimize vector search speed or implement complex knowledge graphs with Neo4j[cite: 26, 27].
* [cite_start]You want to automate a messy, multi-tool workflow using LLM agents[cite: 44].
